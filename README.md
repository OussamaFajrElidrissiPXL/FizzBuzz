## Notable Projects

### 1. Order Picker Robot Simulation with PyQt and Python
In this project, I developed a PyQt frontend application that simulates communication with an order picker robot. The application allows packages to be added to a queue, and the robot calculates the shortest route to deliver each package to a specified dock. This project showcases my skills in Python, GUI development, and algorithm optimization.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyQt, Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Skills Highlighted**: GUI Development, Simulation, Optimization, and Routing Algorithms

### 2. AI Multi-Agent System with FastAPI
Using Microsoft's Autogen framework, I built an AI system with multiple agents that communicate via FastAPI. This project leverages Python's asynchronous capabilities to allow agents to process and share information autonomously. This experience deepened my knowledge of backend development, API integration, and multi-agent frameworks.

- **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, Autogen (Microsoft's Multi-Agent Framework)
- **Skills Highlighted**: API Development, Multi-Agent Systems, Python Backend

### 3. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) with Local Runner
During a recent IT project, I worked in an Agile team setting, implementing a CI/CD pipeline hosted on GitHub with a locally managed runner. This process allowed us to manage multiple releases efficiently and ensured a smooth development cycle with automated testing and integration.

- **Tech Stack**: GitHub, CI/CD, Agile Methodology
- **Skills Highlighted**: Version Control, Continuous Deployment, Agile Project Management
